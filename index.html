									<p> My colleagues and I developped and built a database application for a real-world domain.
										we designed an ER schema, created a database using SQL and DB2, populated our database with data.
										In the user-friendly Java interface we have developped application programs for our users.
										These applications allow users to create or update their profile, create a new post (used to sell cards),
										Display Sellers and their average rating, update review on purchased cards. Any changes made through the 
										Java UI are connected to the DB2 database through SQL. From this database, I was also able to export the result
										to make visualizations such as the bar graph and pie chart in the linked github.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/LucaMonteferrante/Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks" class="image fit"><img src="images/KAN model port.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My research in collaboration with Kai Wang Lab was focused on a relatively unexplored neural network (NN) called Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in python and pytorch.
										The research proposal detailed the use cases for machine learning (ML) KAN models in quantum optics. The research itself consisted of analyzing performance
										data from the models differently sized, formatted, arranged data. Once all the data and mechanics of these KAN models were understood, I presented my insights
										to the lab members and interested external researchers to propose applications in quantum optics. Wigner function reconstruction was the chosen application.
										I created a KAN model to take as input data points from a known, complex multivariable function and output an easy to understand, univariate function.
										The reason why this is so important was because in quantum optics, often times situations can be too complex for humans to understand, thus reducing the 
										complexity of the situation helps researchers understand the optics better.

									<!-- <p>Unfortunately, the works I've done during my internships at Abbvie Canada is confidential, so it cannot be shared, I truly wish I could because I'm proud of it all. The works I'm referring to are the market share graphs, pie charts for HCPs detailing
										valuable information on products they regularly sell, Dashboards for easily viewable expenses over differnt faculties. And other averages. I would be happy to explain what I
										did but I cannot actually display any of these openly. The softwares I used to make these are Power BI, Excel, Smartsheets, Foundry, Azure. During my time there my most proud
										accomplishment was for a task to automate the monthly market share graph creations in the same professional layout as they previously used. Though now they wanted it in
										Foundry, a completely different software than previously used. I was successfully able to accomplish their request, creating a mechanism which automatically compiled and analyzed data from
										Excel, inputted into Foundry, and updated the graph keeping the last 16 months of market share per product in a professional graph visualized identically to the professional graphs
										used before I was hired.</p> -->
										<p>
											Due to confidentiality, I cannot share the dashboards or visuals I created during my internship at AbbVie Canada, but I can describe the work I completed. 
											My responsibilities included building market share graphs, creating visualizations (bar graphs, plots, pie charts) for HCPs, and developing dashboards to help cross-functional teams easily 
											track essential information. All of this work was done through the use of Power BI, Excel, Smartsheets, Azure 
										</p>
										<p>

											One of my proudest accomplishments was automating the monthly market share reporting process. I was tasked with designing their professional, trademark graphs in another
											platform they recently acquired, Foundry. I created a system to automatically grab unprocessed data from Excel, analyze the data into useful values, and add them to their
											respective plots while maintaining the 16 months of market shares. I was able to significantly reduce the time spent by BI analysts creating graphs and reduce the time to
											deliver insights to shareholders.
										</p>
										<p>
											Another proud accomplishment was that my team and I were able to deliver specialized information/insights to shareholders. One such experience was detailing how
											our in-field team for a specific drug was not targeting the correct physicians. I learned this by using H1 (a platform they
											had never used before) to acquire more recent and accurate data, and exported queried data into Excel and Power BI to
											analyze and present insights as to why they were not optimized in their choices.

									<a href="https://github.com/LucaMonteferrante/Histopathological-Image-Classification-and-Segmentation" class="image fit"><img src="images/histo port copy.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Under the supervision of Siamak Ravanbakhsh, my research group took an interest in classifying and segmenting cancerous cells across the body.
										Each of us took one region of the body, and analyzed data from histopathological images of that region's cells. Using a Python and Pytorch,
										we trained models capable of classifying whether the image contained no cancerous tumors, or if it did contain cancerous tumor(s), then classify
										the image by the name of the tumor. For instance the lung images I was responsible for had multiple types of cancerous tissue in them. My model was
										able to classify them with 96.7% accuracy. Once classified, we then attempted to segment the image to locate the cancerous tissues. This process was difficult
										depending on the quality of the images. In my lung region, segmentation was a success. We wrote a research paper documenting our work and presented our findings.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/LucaMonteferrante/AI-Reversi-Othello-Agent">Artificial Intelligence Reversi/Othello Agent<br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/LucaMonteferrante/AI-Reversi-Othello-Agent" class="image fit"><img src="images/reversi port.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I entered an AI competition to determine who can create an AI agent to best play Reversi (otherwise known as Othello). Out of 200+ competitors, I placed
										10th in the competition. Note that this competition involved heavy usage of UI and GUI. My AI agent was also capable of defeating any human who attempted to play against it. The rules of the competition were to create an AI agent who understands the rules of the game, and must make moves in under 2.0 seconds.
										If a legal move is not made within that timeframe, the Agent loses their turn. The board size would also change randomly, from square dimensions from 6x6 to 12x12. In the classic version,
										the 8x8 board has about 10^28 legal positions. For a 12x12 board my AI agent could be faced with any of 10^68 possible states. I needed to create an agent which had the best heuristics and policy for a time-efficient agent, as this many possibilities
										require my agent to analyze exponentially more data. Note that for the competition, this limit was chosen because it's impossibe to perfectly check each state even in the smallest board size in that time.

									<p>Using UI and GUI from Java, I was able to create a game of choosing different paths to traverse different maps. Each map has different sizes and tiles. Each tile has different properties,
										altering the optimal path to be taken. There are also quick traversal paths which offer users the ability to travel to another connected region. This passion project was a fun, week long project to
										complete a game within a short time-frame. I made an easy to understand UI/GUI for the users which clearly visualizes important information (data) to give appropriate insights for users to choose their
										prefered path. </p>
